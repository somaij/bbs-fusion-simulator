<h1>How to Get Blitz in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</h1>
<p>Blitz is one of those commands that quietly becomes way more useful than you’d expect. At first glance,
    it’s just a physical multi-hit move, but once you start digging into command melding, you’ll find that
    Blitz is a core ingredient in some of the strongest commands in the game like Sonic Blade, Ars
    Arcanum/Solum, Magic Hour, Meteor Crash and Triple Firaga/Blizzaga.</p>

    <h3>How to Meld Blitz (My Go-To Recipes)</h3>
    <p>There are a few reliable ways to create Blitz depending on your character:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient 1</th>
                <th>Ingredient 2</th>
                <th>Works for</th>
                <th>Simulator Link</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

                        href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Stun%20Edge&cmd2=Slot%20Edge">Try this combo</a>
                </td>

    <h3>Which Crystal Should You Use?</h3>
    <p>If you're going for Blitz, here are the crystals I personally recommend:</p>
    <p>Pulsing Crystal → This is my default pick: you can get Finish Boost, which adds a nice bump to your
        finisher moves.</p>
    <p>Wellspring Crystal → Want more hits in your deck? This gives you Combo Plus or Air Combo Plus.</p>
    <p>I've made the mistake of not leveling Blitz before melding it into something else. Don’t be like me.
        If you want to keep the ability you get from your crystal, make sure Blitz is fully leveled first.

    <h3>Commands That Use Blitz as an Ingredient</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve created Blitz, don’t stop there. It becomes part of several high-end commands you’ll want
        later, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sonic Blade (great against single targets)</li>
        <li>Meteor Crash (Terra’s heavy-hitter)</li>
        <li>Triple Firaga / Triple Blizzaga (Aqua only)</li>
        <li>Ars Arcanum (Ventus' late-game staple)</li>
        <li>Magic Hour (Aqua only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Blitz is basically your gateway to all the flashy stuff that melts health bars.</p>

<h3>Want to Test Your Melding Path?</h3>
<p>If you're not sure which recipe to use — or want to avoid wasting rare crystals — head over to the <a
        href="/">Command Melding Simulator</a> on this site. You can preview which command and ability
    you'll get before you commit to a meld.</p>

<p>If you're playing Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep and you're building a fast, physical deck or prepping
    for late-game finishers, Blitz is 100% worth crafting early. It’s one of the most flexible commands in
    the game — and if you plan ahead with the right crystals, it’ll pay off in a big way.</p>
