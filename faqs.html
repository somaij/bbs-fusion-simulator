				<div class="faq">
					<h3>What is melding in KH BBS?</h3>
					<p>In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, it's possible to meld (combine) commands to create new and
						more
						powerful commands. When you attach an item to a command meld, you get a passive ability on the
						newly
						created command.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h3>Why should I level up commands?</h3>
					<p>When you have the command in the active battle command deck or action command deck, the passive
						ability
						will be equipped. By fully leveling up your command, you will earn the passive command
						permanently</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h3>What do Crystals do in Command Melding?</h3>
					<p>Crystals determine what ability will be attached to the newly created command.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h3>How do I get Second Chance?</h3>
					<p>Second Chance is a powerful ability that lets you survive a strong attack with 1 HP. The most
						reliable way to get it is by using a Pulsing Crystal during melding. For example:</p>
					<p>Blizzara + Blizzara + Pulsing Crystal</p>
					<a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Blizzara&cmd2=Blizzara&crystal=Pulsing">View in simulator</a>
				</div>
				<div class="faq">
					<h3>How do I get Once More?</h3>
					<p>Once More is similar to Second Chance but works against multi-hit attacks in a single combo. To
						get Once More, you’ll also need to use a Wellspring Crystal. Try this combo:</p>
					<p>Fira + Fira + Wellspring Crystal</p>
					<a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Fira&cmd2=Fira&crystal=Wellspring">See in meld simulator</a>
				</div>

						commands as
						soon as you are able.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="faq">
