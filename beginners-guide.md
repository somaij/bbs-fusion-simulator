<h1>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep: Beginner’s Guide to Command Melding</h1>

<p>New to <strong>Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</strong>? One of the most important systems to master early on is Command Melding — a feature that lets you combine two commands with a crystal to create stronger abilities and unlock powerful passive effects. This guide will walk you through the basics of melding, why it matters, and how to make the best choices when starting out.</p>

<div class="faq">
<h3>What is Command Melding?</h3>
<p>Command Melding allows you to fuse two battle commands (like Blizzard or Stun Edge) to create a brand-new command that’s stronger or completely different. When you add a crystal to the mix, the resulting command will also carry a passive ability — such as Combo Plus, Second Chance, or Leaf Bracer — which can give you a major advantage in battle.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h3>Why Melding is Important (Especially for Beginners)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock Critical Survival Abilities:</strong> Abilities like <a href="/second-chance">Second Chance</a> and <a href="/once-more">Once More</a> are only obtainable through melding and are required for surviving boss fights on higher difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>Permanent Passive Boosts:</strong> When you fully level up a command that has an ability, you keep that ability permanently, even after swapping out the command.</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Playstyle:</strong> Whether you want to focus on magic, melee, or defense, melding lets you shape your character’s strengths.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h3>How to Meld Commands: Step-by-Step</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Command Melding Menu</strong> (available after the first few story events).</li>
<li>Select two commands that you want to fuse. These can be either battle commands or action commands.</li>
<li>Add a crystal (optional but recommended) to influence the ability attached to the new command.</li>
<li>Preview the result (or use our <a href="/">Fusion Simulator</a> to see the guaranteed result ahead of time).</li>
<li>Confirm the meld to create the new command!</li>
</ol>

<h3>What Do Crystals Do in Command Melding?</h3>
<p>Crystals determine the passive ability that will be attached to your newly melded command. Each crystal type influences the type of ability you receive. Here's what each one provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shimmering:</strong> Grants elemental damage abilities such as Fire Boost, Blizzard Boost, and various elemental damage reduction (like Fire Screen) that reduce damage from specific elements.</li>
<li><strong>Pulsing:</strong> Provides powerful defensive and offensive abilities such as <a href="/second-chance">Second Chance</a>, <a href="/leaf-bracer">Leaf Bracer</a>, Finish Boost, and Combo F Boost.</li>
<li><strong>Wellspring:</strong> Unlocks supportive offensive abilities like Combo Plus and Air Combo Plus, as well as the critical survival skill, <a href="/once-more">Once More</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Fleeting:</strong> Improves command recharge speed with abilities such as Attack Haste, Magic Haste, and Reload Boost.</li>
<li><strong>Hungry:</strong> Enhances prize collection with abilities like HP Prize Plus and Treasure Magnet, increasing the number and pull range of dropped prizes.</li>
<li><strong>Soothing:</strong> Boosts survivability with defensive support abilities like HP Boost, Defender, and Damage Syphon, which helps restore focus or health.</li>
<li><strong>Abounding:</strong> Offers rare and growth-based abilities such as EXP Chance, <a href="/exp-walker">EXP Walker</a>, and Lucky Strike to improve drop quality and experience gains.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<h3>Melding Tips for Beginners</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always check the required command level.</strong> Some melds need level 3 commands to produce the best results, where as lower commands only need a level 2.</li>
<li>Always fully level up your commands to retain the ability</li>
<li><strong>Don’t waste rare crystals early.</strong> Use common ones like Fleeting for less critical abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Use our <a href="/">Fusion Simulator</a></strong> to preview results and avoid mistakes!</li>
</ul>
