<h1>How to Get Second Chance in Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</h1>

<p>If you’ve ever been one-shot by a tough boss in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, you already know why Second Chance is so important. This passive ability ensures you always survive with 1 HP after a combo, giving you a fighting chance to heal, counter, or escape. Without it, higher difficulties like Proud or Critical can feel almost unfair.</p>

<h3>Why Second Chance is Essential</h3>

<p>When I first played through Birth by Sleep, I kept hitting a wall with certain bosses — no matter how much I leveled, I’d lose all my HP in one chain of attacks. Once I unlocked Second Chance, the game felt completely different. It’s the kind of safety net you don’t want to play without.</p>

<h3>The Difference between Second Chance and Once More</h3>

<p>Second Chance will protect you against one-shot HP bar ending moves, where as Once More will help you survive combo strings.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Find a pulsing crystal</h2>
<p>You can only get Second Chance through Command Melding, and it requires a Pulsing Crystal as part of the fusion. It drops mostly from Bruiser type enemies (large Unversed), as early as Enchanted Dominion.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Meld Second Chance using a Pulsing Crystal</h2>
<p>Here are some practical commands you can use meld for all characters:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredients</th>
            <th>Result</th>
            <th>Try meld</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Blizzara + Blizzara</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Blizzaga</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Blizzara&cmd2=Blizzara&crystal=Pulsing">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Aerora + Aerora</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Aeroga</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Aerora&cmd2=Aerora&crystal=Pulsing">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Zero Gravira + Zero Gravira</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Zero Graviga</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Zero%20Gravira&cmd2=Zero%20Gravira&crystal=Pulsing">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>And here are some ways you can get it for some unique commands.</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredients</th>
            <th>Result</th>
            <th>Try meld</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Sonic Blade + Stopga</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Ars Solum</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Sonic%20Blade&cmd2=Stopga&crystal=Pulsing">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Blitz + Aerial Slam</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Ars Arcanium</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Blitz&cmd2=Aerial%20Slam&crystal=Pulsing">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Blizzaga + Mine Shield</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Ice Barrage</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Blizzaga&cmd2=Mine%20Shield&crystal=Pulsing">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<h2>Step 3: Level the Command</h2>
<p>After you create the command, don’t forget to <strong>level it up fully</strong>. Once it’s maxed out, you’ll 
obtain Second Chance permanently, even if you remove the command later. You'll be more set up for the end game with your character after ensuring you have this passive ability.</p>

<h3>Tips for Getting It Early</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Farm for Pulsing Crystals early. You’ll find them from Bruisers in Enchanted Dominion and later worlds.</li>
    <li>If you’re playing Aqua or Ventus, prioritize Second Chance before advancing too far. It makes upcoming bosses much safer.</li>
    <li>Always level the command that grants Second Chance. Once it maxes out, the ability becomes permanent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Recommendation</h2>

<p>Don’t wait too long to make this ability. Second Chance and Once More together form the backbone of survival in Birth by Sleep. Once you have them, you’ll feel much more confident experimenting with offensive melds instead of worrying about getting wiped instantly.</p>
