			<h1>FAQs About Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Command Melding</h1>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>What is melding in KH BBS?</h3>
				<p>In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, it's possible to meld (combine) commands to create new and
					more
					powerful commands. When you attach an item to a command meld, you get a passive ability on the
					newly
					created command.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>Why should I level up commands?</h3>
				<p>When you have the command in the active battle command deck or action command deck, the passive
					ability
					will be equipped. By fully leveling up your command, you will earn the passive command
					permanently</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>What do Crystals do in Command Melding?</h3>
				<p>Crystals determine what ability will be attached to the newly created command.</p>
			</div>
      <div class="ad-wrapper-article">
          {% include adsense_in_article.html %}
      </div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>How do I get Second Chance?</h3>
				<p>Second Chance is a powerful ability that lets you survive a strong attack with 1 HP. The most
					reliable way to get it is by using a Pulsing Crystal during melding. For example:</p>
				<p>Blizzara + Blizzara + Pulsing Crystal</p>
				<a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Blizzara&cmd2=Blizzara&crystal=Pulsing">View in simulator</a> | <a href="/second-chance">Read the Second Chance guide</a>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>How do I get Once More?</h3>
				<p>Once More is similar to Second Chance but works against multi-hit attacks in a single combo. To
					get Once More, you’ll also need to use a Wellspring Crystal. Try this combo:</p>
				<p>Fira + Fira + Wellspring Crystal</p>
				<a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Fira&cmd2=Fira&crystal=Wellspring">See in meld simulator</a> | <a href="/once-more">Read the Once More guide</a>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>How do I get Leaf Bracer</h3>
				<p>Leaf Bracer allows you to finish healing spells without being interrupted by enemy attacks. It's
					attached to commands using a Pulsing Crystal. Here's one way to get it:</p>
				<p>Fire Dash + Fira + Pulsing</p>
				<a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Fire%20Dash&cmd2=Fira&crystal=Pulsing">Try it in the meld
					simulator</a> | <a href="/leaf-bracer">Read the Leaf Bracer guide</a>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>What are the different types of fusion commands?</h3>
				<p>There are 5 types of commands that you can fuse in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Physical</li>
					<li>Magic</li>
					<li>Movement</li>
					<li>Defense</li>
					<li>Shotlock</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To make the most out of your available space, it's recommended to meld defense and movement
					commands as
					soon as you are able.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Shotlocks cannot have passive ablities attached to them.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>How do I get rare commands?</h3>
				<p>Some commands can only be obtained through specific melding combinations (and some may have a low
					probability of your preferred outcome) or by purchasing them from Moogle Shops.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>How do I level up commands faster?</h3>
				<p>Equip the commands in your deck, use them in battle. Take advantage of Mirage Arena for quick
					leveling and the Maximum Level Mickey D-Link for Double EXP. You can also meld <a href="/exp-walker">EXP Walker</a> - an ability that gives you 1 exp per step.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>Which Crystals give the best abilities?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Shimmering Crystal:</strong> Enhances magic-based abilities. <br></li>
					<li>
						<strong>Pulsing Crystal:</strong> Useful for defensive abilities like <a href="/second-chance">Second Chance</a> and <a href="/leaf-bracer">Leaf Bracer</a>.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Wellspring Crystal:</strong> Increases the chance of getting support-based
						abilities and <a href="/once-more">Once More</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>What happens if I use the wrong ingredients?</h3>
				<p>Not all melds result in useful commands! Some combinations might create a command with an ablity
					you
					already have. Using this tool helps you avoid trial and error.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faq">
				<h3>Can I undo a command meld?</h3>
