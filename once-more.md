<h1>How to Get <em>Once More</em> in Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</h1>
<p>
    If <strong>Second Chance</strong> saves you from one-hit kills, <strong>Once More</strong> is what lets you survive crazy combos and boss flurries.
    I still remember the first time a late-game boss locked me in a chain of hits - without Once More, it was game over (ahem, Xehanort!).
    With it equipped, you can hang on with 1 HP and heal or counterattack.

<h2>Step 1: Find a wellspring crystal</h2>
<p>You can only get Once More through Command Melding, and it requires a Wellspring Crystal as part of the fusion. It drops mostly from Scrapper Unversed as early as Enchanted Dominion, or Triple Wrecker in Neverland.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Melding Once More</h2>
<p>
    You’ll need to fuse commands with a <strong>Wellspring Crystal</strong>. Here are some of the basic recipes for all characters:

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Ingredients</th>
        <th>Result</th>
        <th>Try meld</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Fira + Fira</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Firaga</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Fira&cmd2=Fira&crystal=Wellspring">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Firaga + Aeroga</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Fission Firaga</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Firaga&cmd2=Aeroga&crystal=Wellspring">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Magnera + Magnera</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Magnega</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Magnera&cmd2=Magnera&crystal=Wellspring">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>And for cool character specific commands, try these!</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Ingredients</th>
        <th>Result</th>
        <th>Try meld</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Dark Haze + Sonic Blade</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Ars Solum</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Dark%20Haze&cmd2=Sonic%20Blade&crystal=Wellspring">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Firaga + Glide</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Fire Glide</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Firaga&cmd2=Glide&crystal=Wellspring">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td data-label="Ingredients">Stun Edge + Binding Strike</td>
            <td data-label="Result">Wishing Strike (for a super early meld)</td>
            <td data-label="Try it"><a href="/?mode=simulator&cmd1=Stun%20Edge&cmd2=Binding%20Strike&crystal=Wellspring">Simulate</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Step 3: Level the Command</h2>
<p>Once you create the command, don’t forget to <strong>level it up completely</strong>. Once it’s maxed out, you’ll 
get Once More permanently, even if you remove the command later. You'll be more set up for end game bosses with your character after ensuring you have this passive ability.</p>


<h3>My Personal Strategy</h3>
<p>
    I always prioritize unlocking <strong>Second Chance</strong> first — it saves you from unlucky one-shots that early game bosses tend to do over combos. Then I immediately go for Once More.
    With both abilities equipped, I felt like the game finally became “fair.” You can take on bosses knowing that no single combo will rob you of a chance to fight back. In my eyes, both Second Chance and Once More are required abilities to take on the final bosses of the game.
